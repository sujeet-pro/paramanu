# Paramanu Design System

Themeable, accessible design system monorepo (pnpm + turbo). Components in per-group packages: `-js` + `-react`.

All guidelines are in `agents-guidelines/`. Read the relevant file before working.

See `CLAUDE.md` for architecture and `components-list.md` for component list.
