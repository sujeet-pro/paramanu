## What does Paramanu mean?

**Paramanu** (परमाणु) is a Sanskrit term meaning **atom** — the smallest, indivisible particle of matter. In the ancient Indian Vaisheshika school of philosophy, paramanu represented the fundamental building blocks from which all physical reality is composed.

This design system carries the same idea: **the smallest, composable building blocks for crafting web interfaces**. Each token, style, and component is a paramanu — minimal, purposeful, and designed to combine into something greater.

## Why Paramanu?

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="CSS-First, Zero Runtime" icon="seti:css">
    Built entirely on CSS custom properties and `@layer` cascade ordering. No JavaScript is needed
    for styling — your buttons, inputs, and layouts work without a framework.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Three Consumption Modes" icon="puzzle">
    Drop in via **CDN** with human-readable classes, use as **CSS Modules** in bundled apps for
    scoped styles, or import **React components** with full type safety.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Accessible by Default" icon="heart">
    Every component ships WCAG 2.2 AA compliant. Focus-visible indicators, semantic HTML, `aria`
    attributes, and automated testing with axe-core — accessibility isn't an afterthought.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Modern CSS" icon="star">
    CSS nesting, `light-dark()` for automatic dark mode, `@layer` for predictable cascade, container
    queries, and `@scope` — built for how CSS works today.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Three Ways to Use

Choose the integration that fits your project:

<Tabs syncKey="consumption-mode">
  <TabItem label="CDN">
    Link the stylesheet and start using classes immediately. No build tools needed.

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@paramanu/cdn/dist/paramanu.css">

    <button class="pm-btn pm-btn--primary pm-btn--md">
      Get Started
    </button>
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="CSS Modules">
    Import as CSS Modules for scoped class names in bundled applications.

    ```js
    import classes from "@paramanu/buttons-js/modules/button/map"

    const btn = document.createElement("button")
    btn.className = classes["pm-btn"] + " " + classes["pm-btn--primary"]
    btn.textContent = "Get Started"
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="React">
    Import typed React components with full prop autocompletion.

    ```tsx
    import { Btn } from "@paramanu/buttons-react"

    export default function App() {
      return <Btn variant="primary" size="md">Get Started</Btn>
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Design Principles

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Minimal by Design">
    Every component does one thing well. No bloated bundles, no hidden dependencies, no surprise
    side effects. Ship only what you use.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Composable">
    Tokens feed into components, components combine into patterns. Override any layer without
    fighting specificity wars.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Progressive Enhancement">
    Starts with semantic HTML and CSS. Layer on JavaScript interactivity only when needed. Works
    without JS, shines with it.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Themeable">
    Swap design tokens at the root level to re-skin everything. Built-in `light-dark()` support
    means dark mode with one CSS property.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
